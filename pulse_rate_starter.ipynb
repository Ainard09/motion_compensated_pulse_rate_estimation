    "This is a Troika datasets from a journal paper; Zhilin Zhang, Zhouyue Pi, Benyuan Liu, ‘‘TROIKA: A General Framework for Heart Rate Monitoring Using Wrist-Type Photoplethysmographic Signals During Intensive Physical Exercise,’’IEEE Trans. on Biomedical Engineering, vol. 62, no. 2, pp. 522-531, February 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two-channel PPG signals, three-axis acceleration signals, and one-channel ECG signals were simultaneously recorded from subjects with age from 18 to 35. There are 12 subjects and they are all males. For each subject, the PPG signals were recorded from wrist by two pulse oximeters with green LEDs (wavelength: 515nm). All signals were sampled at 125 Hz and sent to a nearby computer via Bluetooth.\n",
    "Each dataset contains a variable 'sig'. It has 6 rows. The first row is a simultaneous recording of ECG, which is recorded from the chest of each subject. The second row and the third row are two channels of PPG, which are recorded from the wrist of each subject. The last three rows are simultaneous recordings of acceleration data (in x-, y-, and z-axis).\n",
    "The short-coming with the dataset is that is the demographic representative,it does not include females candidate. The age could also have an impact because people below 18 and above 35 most likely to use the algorithm might not give a better results since the model was not exposed to similar data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes into account the heart rate and how confident it is. Firstly, we limit our sampling rate between 40bpm to 240bpm. Since the subjects could be moving their arm due to exercise program, ppg sensor might pick signals which ain't from the heart rhythm. The algorithm deals with this by picking frequency that has largest dominant and search for peaks within the range of the dominating frequency to calculate how confident it is. The algorithm compares the ground truth to the predicted freqency (how distant is the predicted values are to the ground truth). The algorithm picks the 90% strongest confidence values and find the average of their corresponding absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes advantage of the blood capillaries and the green light from the PPG sensor emits into the vessels. When the heart ventricles contract, it pumps bloods to the body capillaries and this increases the volume of blood vessel thus, this absorbes the green lights, little light will be reflected and detected by the photodector. Once the heart ventricles repolarised, the bloods leave the capillaries and more light is reflected back tot the photodector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes the wearer is performing intense activity and it tries to carefully calculate it's metric by removing the arm movement artifacts. Occasionally, it might pick the arm movements and gives false outputs resulting in failure mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training datasets gives mean absolute error(MAE) of **15.7** and the test dataset gives **9.13**\n",
    "The lower the MAE, the better the perforomance of the algorithm. This implies their still improvement to be consider for the algorithm on the training dataset. Maybe selecting a model train_test_split for the train and test will improve the performance of the model. There will be limition since the dataset are collected from exercise programs that include only, running, jogging and walking. There would be performance derange on users under the water swimming and  demographic limitation of only male and age bin 18-35 could give population outside of this reference a failure modes. "
